In this lab, you can learn how to use terraform and spinnaker for well-architected containerized modern application. We use terraform for infrastructure management tool and use AWS CodeBuild that is a fully managed continuous integration tool on AWS for container build, and use spinnaker for continuous delivery pipeline and kuberetes workloads. Also, you can learn what is service mesh and whay we use it for distibuted and complex containerized mircoservices. AWS Mesh is a fully managed service mesh service on AWS, we will use it for traffic management.
